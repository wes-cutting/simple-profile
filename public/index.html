      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      <p>
        I identify as nerd, gamer, Trekkie, Whovian, Questarian, biker, glover, engineer, Brown Coat, Cumberbitch,
        Hiddlestoner, geek, reader, writer, amateur photographer, builder of things, fixer of stuff, and Batmaniac.
        That’s just the tip of the iceberg that represents me as an evolving individual.

      <p>
        I never like to feel set in my ways and am constantly looking for better ways to operate as a person, no matter the task at hand.
